# powerschool-api-go

This repository is for a PowerSchool GoLang API Client. This is a work in 
progress and will take quite a bit of time to complete, if at all. The goal is 
to make it easier to build applications around the API whilst going around all 
the extra steps.

I will be starting with Students and then making my way around based on my needs 
for work. I don't know if I will do every single endpoint as I may have no need 
to.
